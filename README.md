# DELFI Superset Dashboard 

This repo provides for a superset-based dashboard providing insights into
various DELFI data aspects. For now, i.e. insights regarding DELFI's zHV (the Geramn national stop registry) are provided.

## Prerequisites

As a prerequisite you need docker installed, as this setup is based on a dockerized superset installation (credits to Maliha Sameen, who described such a setup in her blog post "[Quick Setup: Configure Superset with Docker](https://medium.com/towards-data-engineering/quick-setup-configure-superset-with-docker-a5cca3992b28)"), and an DELFI zhv/osm comparison sqlite3 as generated by https://github.com/mfd/nvbw-osm-stop-comparison.

## Start dashboard

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adapt according to your setup. Then start superset via


```sh
$ docker compose up -d
```

## Importing dashboards

```sh
$ docker exec superset-2 superset import-directory --overwrite /dashboards/dashboard_kreis
$ docker exec superset-2 superset import-directory --overwrite /dashboards/dashboard_deutschland
```
