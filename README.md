# DELFI Superset Dashboard 

This repo provides a [superset](https://superset.apache.org/)-based dashboard providing insights into various [DELFI zHV](https://www.opendata-oepnv.de/ht/de/organisation/delfi/startseite?tx_vrrkit_view%5Baction%5D=details&tx_vrrkit_view%5Bcontroller%5D=View&tx_vrrkit_view%5Bdataset_formats%5D%5B0%5D=ZIP&tx_vrrkit_view%5Bdataset_name%5D=deutschlandweite-haltestellendaten&cHash=600ea37b04ec44801a6943e824b3bfca) (Germany's stop registry) data aspects. For now, i.e. insights regarding DELFI's zHV (the Geramn national stop registry) are provided.

## Prerequisites

As a prerequisite you need docker installed, as this setup is based on a dockerized superset installation (credits to Maliha Sameen, who described such a setup in her blog post "[Quick Setup: Configure Superset with Docker](https://medium.com/towards-data-engineering/quick-setup-configure-superset-with-docker-a5cca3992b28)"), and an DELFI zhv/osm comparison duckdb Database as generated by https://github.com/mfd/transit-stops-osm-comparison.

## Start dashboard

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adapt according to your setup. Then start superset via


```sh
$ docker compose up -d
```

## Importing dashboards

```sh
$ docker exec superset-2 superset import-directory --overwrite /dashboards/dashboard_kreis
$ docker exec superset-2 superset import-directory --overwrite /dashboards/dashboard_deutschland
```
